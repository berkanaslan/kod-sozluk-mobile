<p><strong>kod sözlük</strong> is a social platform where users can share their definitions about anything they want. It's called a kind of collaborative dictionary and it copies that mission from <strong>eksisozluk.com</strong>. Long story short, <strong>it aims to clone all the features</strong> on eksisozluk.com.</p>

<p><strong>kod sözlük is not just a front-end side clone.</strong> It also aims to clone the back-end side.
